# HephAIStos Blog

Let's build an AI agent by setting up 3 key systems! 🛠️
Welcome to the official HephAIStos blog! Here we'll discuss:
Let’s explore the cool tools that empower our agent! 🔧

- Tool architecture
  A Tool Registry (like a magical toolbox!) 🧰
- Agent core design
  A Planner (our decision-making wizard) 🧙

An Agent Core (the conductor of our orchestra) 🎵

- New file-based operation system
- Enhanced context tracking
- Safety improvements for file operations

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Try the CLI with `python -m hephaistos_cli "Your goal here"`

## Roadmap

- Add LLM-based planning
- Expand toolset
- Improve error handling

Stay tuned for more updates!

### Tool Implementations Details

Each tool should include:

1. Input validation
2. Context-aware execution
3. Error handling with clear messages
4. Example: A `search_text_in_files` tool could add regex support and file type filters

### CLI Interface Enhancements

The CLI should:

1. Parse complex command structures
2. Support interactive mode with auto-completion
3. Display progress bars for long operations
4. Allow configuration through YAML files

```## CLI Interface Details

The CLI interface allows users to interact with HephAIStos through terminal commands. Key features include:

- **Real-time logging**: Displays each step the agent takes during execution
- **Goal tracking**: Shows progress indicators as the agent works
- **Interactive mode**: Allows users to interrupt and modify goals dynamically

Example usage:
```bash
python -m hephaistos_cli "Create a Python script that calculates Fibonacci numbers"
````

This would trigger the agent to:

1. Plan the implementation steps
2. Write the script file
3. Verify the logic
4. Provide usage instructions## Utilities Implementation

The utility system includes:

1. **File sandboxing** – Prevents unintended system modifications
2. **Input clamping** – Limits file operations to specific directories
3. **Error recovery** – Handles failed operations gracefully

These utilities ensure the agent operates safely while maintaining flexibility for development tasks.## Future Development

Planned enhancements include:

- LLM-based planner implementation
- Multi-language support for code generation
- Interactive visualization of planning steps
- Advanced scratchpad management features

The modular architecture makes these upgrades straightforward while maintaining core functionality.
