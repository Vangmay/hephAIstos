When asking for the capital of India I am being hit with the following message on the console.

```
Okay, the user is asking for the capital of India. Let me think. The tools available are chat, read_file, write_file, append_file, list_dir, search_text_in_files, run_python_script, and delete_file (but delete_file is disabled). Since the question is a general knowledge one, the chat tool is the right choice here. The user didn't mention any files, so I don't need to use any file-related tools. The scratchpad is empty, so there's no prior context to consider. I should just provide the answer through the chat tool. The capital of India is New Delhi. So I'll use the chat tool to respond with that information.
